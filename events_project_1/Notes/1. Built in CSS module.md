# CSS module support:
- Next JS provides us with the support of built in CSS module.
- So that the style does not spill over other components

- To use this:
- We have to create files with extension: .module.css

- Then in corresponding js files, we import the css file as:
- import classes from 'path of the file';

- This classes will be an object with all the classes that are defined in the CSS file
- It is not necessary to use the word "classes" here, we can use whatever we want.
