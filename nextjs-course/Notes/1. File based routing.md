# File based routing:
- NEXT JS provides us file based routing
- Inside the pages (mandatory) folder, we have to arrange our files and folders in such a way that they replicate our routes.

- Like:

pages
--> index.js  (It is a special file name, it will be considered as the root page of our application, like: localhost:3000/)
--> about.js  (It will work for: localhost:3000/about)
--> portfolio (Folder)
----> index.js  (Work for: localhost:3000/portfolio)
----> list.js   (Work for: localhost:3000/portfolio/list)
----> [id].js   (It is a special file name, says that id is a dynamic path, works for: localhost:3000/portfolio/anyid)

- To access the dynamic id, we need to import:
  - For functional component: import { useRouter } from "next/router";  -> useRouter: hook
  - For class component: import { withRouter } from "next/router";  -> withRouter: High Order Component, can be wrapped around normal class based component to get a special "router" prop injected into our component.


# Syntax for useRouter hook:
const router = useRouter();

// Try console logging "router.pathname" and "router.query"
- router.query -> gives us an object with proper data in the url

- To see the more complex example of routing, see the clients folder inside the pages folder


# Different types of queries:
- We want to support localhost:3000/blog/blogid
- But we also want to support urls like:
  - localhost:3000/blog/2020/blogid
  - localhost:3000/blog/2020/12/blogid
- And we want to do it with a single route
- So not only the values are dynamic but also the number of values is dynamic
- We can use spread operator in the file name in this case.
- For eg. see the blog folder inside the pages folder


# Link:
- For navigating, we use Link tag imported from "next/Link";
- Syntax eg. <Link href="/portfolio">Portfolio</Link>

- "replace" attribute can also be used to replace the url with the given url
- Syntax eg. <Link replace href="/portfolio">Portfolio</Link>
- With "replace" attrubute, we cannot go backwards to the previous page


- Suppose we are writing something like this:
- <ul>
-   {clients.map((client) => {
-     return (
-       <li key={client.id}>
-         <Link href={`/clients/${client.id}`}>{client.name}</Link>
-       </li>
-     );
-   })}
- </ul>

- NEXT JS provides us an alternative way to write this:
- {clients.map((client) => {
-   return (
-     <li key={client.id}>
-       <Link href={{
-         pathname: "/clients/[id]",
-         query: {id: client.id}
-       }}>{client.name}</Link>
-     </li>
-   );
- })}


- Now suppose we want to navigate to another page on the completion of something
- Something like when we login, we go to the dashboard
- Here we can use: useRouter hook
- const router = useRouter();
- router.push('/dashboard/abcd');
- OR
- router.push({
  path: "/dashboard/[id]",
  query: {id: "abcd"}
})

- If we use router.replace(""), then we cannot go back to the previous page after the navigation

- For our own custom 404 page, we can create a file with name as 404.js in the pages folder
